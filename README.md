# Procedural Compute Demos

This repo contains demo files for executing tasks on the Procedural Compute platform using `Rhino/Grasshopper`, `Blender` and headless plain-Python `Jupyter notebooks`.

## What is Procedural Compute?

Compute is a cloud-based SaaS framework for simplifying the queuing and execution of complex and comptationally-heavy tasks on cloud infrastructure.  Compute contains a simple and consistent API-based interface so that users may easily post tasks to the Compute infrastructure.

Compute contains various libraries and interfaces that simplify and streamline execution of particular tasks on the cloud - currently these are CFD, daylight and energy modelling for building-physics type tasks.  However these libraries will be extended in the future to include other tasks such as training machine-learning models; generic data-process and analytics; and other such tasks that require compute resources.
