# Jupyter notebook compute demos

This folder contains demos for executing compute tasks using a "headless" client such as a plain python script or Jupyter notebook.

## Why would we want to do this?

This can be very useful if you are using systems or processes that are not based around or compatible with the other clients we have such as Rhino, C#, Revit or Blender.  

Perhaps you have a modelling program that outputs a building model as an STL - then you want to use that STL model without any other client or interface to simply run tasks on Compute?  Using these scripts you can do this.
